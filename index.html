        This document describes an approach for interacting with browsers using a remote debugging protocol. The approach is to define a common remote debugging protolcol togerher with a layered API, that allows commuication with browsers in a uniformed way, accross browsers and their runtimes.

        This is probably the froodiest document that you will read all year. It has
        been authored using new means of achieving consensus that have been made 
        possible through nanoethanol implants.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a working group that needed to write a
        specification using nothing but [[HTML5]].
      </p>
      <p>
        It decided to use ReSpec, they went to Last Call inside of a quarter and to
        Rec within six months. They spent most of the rest of their chartered time
        having fun in exotic places.
      </p>
      <p>
        The End.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        The single conformance class described in this specification is 
        the <dfn>cryptoanimal</dfn>, a class of common animals that some crazy
        people don't believe in.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Animals</h2>
      <p>
        There are two primary sorts of <a title='cryptoanimal'>cryptoanimals</a>
        that this specification is concerned with. They are detailed in the 
        following sections.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Unicorn</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>unicorn</dfn> is essentially a horned pegasus with no wings. 
          Unicorns make great pets and can double as babysitters in a pinch.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Dahut</h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>dahut</dfn> is an Alpine animal with legs shorter on one side
          than on the other in order to better walk around the mountain. There
          are two types, with varying on chirality. It is not to be confused 
          with the chamois, a mythical mountain animal with two legs of the same
          size — a logical impossibility that will be clear to anyone who has been
          mountain climbing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further discussion of the <a>dahut</a> can be found in [[!SVGMOBILE12]].
